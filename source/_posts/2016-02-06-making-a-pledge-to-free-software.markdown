I completed a long-wanted TODO item late last year by starting a membership with
the [Free Software Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org), a 501(c)(3) non-profit
in the US that does a huge amount of work to promote, enable, and legally fight
for Free software. Their work is of great importance in keeping the ecosystem of
Free Software alive and healthy both through enabling financial support and
sponsorship of large projects like Git, Boost and BusyBox to name a few, as well
as conducting license compliance work and fighting legal battles to defend and
enable Free Software.

Free software is a topic dear to me - the rights provided to users enabled a lot
of my technical learning growing up: the freedom to read source code and see how
the software I used was created, the freedom to compose it with others into new
software projects, and the freedom to distribute it in the same way and share
with friends. Without these freedoms and the community surrounding these
projects I'm certain that I would not have discovered software development as a
career route until many, many years later.

Looking at the landscape of software development today it seems that Free
Software is losing a ground battle with Open Source, and it's easy to see why
this is the case. Commercial software interests can leverage Open Source in the
creation of their propriatary software with zero repercussions; they owe nobody
anything for their privilege and it's very much the exception not the rule that
theseh companies contribute at all back into the ecosystems that provided so
much crucial help to them. Why use a Free project when you can get nearly
identical Open Source code without licensing headaches?

As wonderful as this is for these companies, their win is the worlds loss. Every
time an improvement is made to an Open Source library in-house and not
contributed back upstream the entire community misses out on the fruit of this
labour. Even small patches rarely make it upstream from the proprietary
codebases where they live.
