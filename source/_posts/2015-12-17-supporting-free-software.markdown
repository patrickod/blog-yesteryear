Today I finally struck a nice TODO item off my list: begin supporting the
[Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) financially. This has
been a wish of mine for the last few months after I had the pleasure of seeing
Bradley Kuhn of the Conservancy speak earlier this year at Linux Fest North
West. Hearing Bradley speak about the Conservancy's work, how it houses and
supports important projects like Git, Mercurial and Busybox to name a few, as
well as the important GPL compliance that the Conservancy both undertakes and
supports made me accutely aware of the underresourced position that Free
Software projects often find themselves in. Particularly in San Francisco where
capital is King it often feels like Free Software is demeaned in some way,
despite it providing the foundation for almost every software company today. 

Free Software is long something I've believed in, having used a lot of it and
produced a tiny amount too. Before moving to SF and getting involved in
Noisebridge, I was quick to mix and confuse both Free and Open Source software,
but through the people I've met in the last 18 months I've come to understand
how Free Software is a strong political choice, not just a convenient license to
choose for your project.

Free Software is a statement of your beliefs in a shared and common good. It's a
statement of your belief in a world of sharing, collaboration, and community.
