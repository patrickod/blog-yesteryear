I realise it's been a while since I last posted. I've had some ideas for meaty blog posts but I've found them to be very difficult to shape into something I actually want to publish. The solution I think is to post more frequently about lighter material in a bid to get the hang of this blogging thing.

Just before Christmas, [Torrie](https://hackerbots.net) took a long train ride from Jack London Square in Oakland to Cleveland on her travels to 31c3. On the way she continued to send me many beautiful photos of her train ride adventure, which made me envious to do a similar journey. She also mentioned her delight in being very productive on the journey, hacking many a thing as the train meandered amongst mountain ranges.

It got me thinking that I'd love to try and repeat her success, and create a small un-event called "hackers on a train". The upcoming [Linux Fest North West](http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/2015) conference in April I think might afford such an opportunity to make this happen.

The idea is simple: instead of taking a ~3 hour flight to Bellingham, WA to attend LFNW, organise a group to ride Amtrak the day before and hack a thing (tm) en route. At the time of writing I've not searched to see if this is a viable travel option, but I'm very hopeful that it will be. I'm excited at the possibility of making this idea a reality.

In other news: I've been working on a new [donations website](https://donate.noisebridge.net) for [Noisebridge](https://noisebridge.net) to help our upcoming fund-raising efforts (source available [here](https://github.com/patrickod/noisebridge-donate)). I'm also helping put together a donation-matching fund to help the effort. Life is busy, life is good.
